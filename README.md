## 0x00 Construct A State Monad
We define the State datatype and take a peek into its inner working. By
manually constructing an instance, weâ€™ll start to get a feel on how the
type separates state management from our stateful computations. As State
depends on a Pair type, we get to know how each portion can be extracted
through the fst and snd Pair instance methods.

### Requirements
This code example runs on a POSIX based system (Linux, OSX, etc) in a [nodejs][2] environment
requiring a version greater than `4.2.x` to be run. If you *have* to work in another environment,
this lesson also has a "plunk" hosted on [Plunker][3] that can be run in browser and can be found
here:

[Lesson Plunk][4]

### Using This Example
This code example and environment is provided on its own branch. To run this locally, just clone
this repository down, check out this branch and run the following commands:

#### Setup Your Dependencies
To setup the lesson, execute this command in the project folder:

```
$ npm run setup
```

#### Run The Code
Once all dependencies have been pulled down, you can then run the example code.

This code runs in a node environment and logs to the console that the code was run in. Once
started, the environment will listen to changes to the files and re-run the code. This allows
you to have immediate feed back to the changes you made. To exit out of the code example,
just press the keystroke `Ctrl+C`.

To run the lesson, execute the following in the project folder:

```
$ npm start
```
